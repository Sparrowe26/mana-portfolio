      <h1>Hi, I'm Mana!</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a game artist and designer from Connecticut, and I've been making
        art and telling stories ever since I could pick up a pencil. From there,
        I studied Game Design and Development at RIT and graduated magna cum
        laude in 2025. My experience in college really opened my world to the
        more techincal sides of game-making, and that only strengthened my
        passion for games.
        <br /><br />I've always been fascinated with games as a medium, and
        getting the chance to work on something fun with similarly passionate
        people has always been a dream of mine. I'm a very positive and colorful
        person, and I love to create things that pop with personality! (I even
        made this portfolio website completely from scratch because I had such a
        specific vision for it, that I had to make it on my own.) Not only that,
        but I think it's really important for the artistic and technical sides
        of games to work together, and I enjoy bridging that gap with my
        knowledge in both fields. I have a lot of pride in the things I
        contribute to, so I want them to be the best they can be. <br /><br />
        Outside of making games, I love things like cosplay, improv comedy, a
        capella, indie music, tabletop RPGs, fiction writing, drawing, and
        cooking. Feel free to contact me with any questions!
