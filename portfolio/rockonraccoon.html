      <h1>Origin</h1>
      <p>
        <i>Rock On, Raccoon!</i> is a game I worked on during MassDigi's Summer
        Innovation Program in 2023. SIP was an internship that spanned over the
        course of the summer where each team made a unique mobile game from
        concept to publication. My team of 6 ended up wanting to make a short
        mobile rhythm game, and thus, <i>Rock On, Raccoon!</i> was born.
      </p>

      <h1>My Contributions</h1>
      <p>
        Firstly, I was the team's character designer, artist, and
        animator. I designed and animated 6 different animal bands, and worked
        with the team on what aesthetic we wanted to go with for each of them. I
        also worked on the design team and created the beatmaps for all of the
        songs in the game.
